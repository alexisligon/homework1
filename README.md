# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Summary

Client wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. Code was refactored without changing the layout and design of the website.

## HTML

I added a title to the webpage, changing it from a generic 'website' to 'Horiseon' after the company. 

Instead of a plethora of divs, I changed the approriate divs to header, footer, section, and aside. 

I added an id attribute to the 'search-engine-optimization' section in order for the link in the header to function properly.

I commented on all changed code.

## CSS

I moved the main content section properties above the benefit aside properties to follow the syntax and flow of HTML. 

I consolidated all sections, headings,  and imgs for a more concise CSS and did the same for the benefits.
